changes to be made on v2:

INNARDS:
 - lower the placement of the controller on the x-bracket screen-mount
 - best place to mount the pi?
    - it can be mounted somewhere on the shelves perhaps, using the spokes/tape method used for the lcd controller
    - pi can go on top of bottom shelf but will need to be elevated to make room for the nuts from the controller
 - power supply (battery)
    - could it be held between a gap in the bottom shelf and a brace on the bottom inside of the frame?
 - shelves can be a little deeper
    - or they can just have the "end-stops" that work or are positioned correctly?
 - top shelf - redesign to accommodate new speakers
 - mount the speaker effectively
    - consider a tunnel/splitter system thing

FRONT/FACE PLATE:
 - front face plate could fit a little better
 - move the mount for the screen controller to the back of the faceplate, under the horizontal port (spokes/tape mthd)

BACK PLATE:
 - best way to mount the rear plates?
    - strong magnets would work, but would need to be JB welded or similar into the places
    - squares in the inside corners of the framem, with metal on the back (or front) and the back plate can have the magnets sticking out/braced inside

ARMS & LEGS:
 - better way to attach these? perhaps utilizing the newer/larger magnets?

WIRING:
 - how to wire both speakers?
    - maybe just do one speaker for him, but print a tunnel/splitter?
    - take it apart and see if it can be minimalized at all
